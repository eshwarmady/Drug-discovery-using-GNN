The LSTMs_create.ipynb file implements our LSTM approach to the solution.
It works on the lig_data.csv(from the dataset_orig.pdf, from a paper by Stahl) dataset that contains only 335 data elements.


The Hack_GAN.ipynb showcases the usage of GANs in countering the same problem.
We tried it both on the lig_data.csv dataset and the fin1.csv(which we obtained from various drugs_smi.smi file, which we found on github)


Both can be executing independently and both provide the necessary outputs.
